# CLAUDE.md

## Repository Overview

GLOBALISE MCP Server for accessing Dutch East India Company (VOC) transcriptions. Main code in `globalise-mcp-server/`. API docs in `globalise-transcriptions-api/`.

## Commands

All commands run from `globalise-mcp-server/`:

```bash
npm run build      # 3 stages: vite UI build → tsc → ensure:db (decompress committed DB)
npm run build:db   # regenerate data/archival-index.sqlite from source (slow; build uses ensure:db)
npm run dev        # tsc --watch (npm run dev:ui rebuilds the viewer on change)
npm run inspector  # build + MCP Inspector against dist/index.js
npm start          # run the built server (node dist/index.js)
npm test           # archival-index + viewer-build + smoke tests
```

## Structure (globalise-mcp-server/)

- `src/index.ts` — entry point, tool registration
- `src/tools/` — search, document, document-viewer, convenience, archival-index
- `src/transports/http-server.ts` — HTTP transport (Railway deployment)
- `src/utils/` — api-client, cache, database (SQLite), document-id, iiif, languages, errors, origin (Origin-header validation, spec MUST), types
- `apps/document-viewer/` — MCP Apps UI, bundled by vite during build
- `scripts/build-archival-db.ts` — regenerates `data/archival-index.sqlite` (committed as `.gz`)

## Conventions

- `offline/` is gitignored; ignore unless explicitly requested.
- Archived CHANGELOG (v1.0–v1.16) and completed/deferred TODOs are in `offline/outdated/`.
- **Do not modify `.gitignore` without explicit user approval.**
- "TODO" or "todo" means `globalise-mcp-server/TODO.md`.
- CLAUDE.md is tracked in git.
- A SessionEnd hook automatically captures `★ Insight` blocks to `offline/INSIGHTS.md`.

## Shell Best Practices (Lesson Learned)

Complex curl commands fail due to shell parsing. Write JSON to a temp file instead of inline `-d '{...}'`. If curl fails with parsing errors, restructure rather than retry.

## Common Errors

- **Vite UI build fails with `Rollup failed to resolve import "openseadragon"`:** the local `node_modules` is stale (predates a dep the committed `package-lock.json` already pins — e.g. an old tree still on vite 5 with no `openseadragon`). Run `npm install` (or `npm ci` for a clean slate) before `npm run build`; do **not** add the import to `rollupOptions.external` (the viewer bundle must inline it). The committed lockfile is correct; only the on-disk install drifted.

## Upstream API Reference

These endpoints are external to the codebase and useful when debugging or modifying the server.

## Deployment

| Branch | URL |
|--------|-----|
| `main` | `https://globalise-mcp-production.up.railway.app/mcp` |
| `feature/*` | `https://globalise-mcp-beta-production.up.railway.app/mcp` |

Health check: `/health` — returns `{ status, name, version, node }`. The `node` field is the runtime version Railway actually selected; `curl <url>/health` to confirm it's `v24.x` after a deploy.

**Auto-deployment:** Railway deploys automatically when pushed to GitHub. Production from `main`, beta from the active feature branch.

**Node version:** Railway's builder selects Node from `globalise-mcp-server/package.json` `engines.node` (`>=24.15.0 <25.0.0`) and `.nvmrc` (`24.16.0`) — Node 24, matching Claude Desktop's bundled runtime. The builder pins the major; the patch is its choice. The code runs on any Node 24.x (the `>=24.15` floor is for Claude Desktop parity, not a hard requirement — `node:sqlite` is flagless from 24.0). To force the major, set the `NIXPACKS_NODE_VERSION=24` service variable. Verify post-deploy via `/health`.

## Version Management

**Every code change requires a version bump.** This has been forgotten in the past.

Update ALL of these (they must match):

1. `package.json` — the only code location; `SERVER_VERSION` (and `/health`) read it at startup
2. `CLAUDE.md` — Current Version below
3. `CHANGELOG.md` — new entry with date
4. `package-lock.json` — run `npm install` (no args) after bumping `package.json` so its two `version` fields follow; don't hand-edit. It has silently lagged before (was stuck at 2.4.0 through v2.5.3).

### Current Version: 2.5.5 (worktree-p0-refactor; tool-description correctness pass on `find_archival_documents` + `search_transcriptions`, from reviewing the `globalise-voc-research` skill against the always-loaded tool descriptions. Two fixes correct descriptions that were independently wrong on their own (skill-less clients got a defective contract): (1) the `settlement` example `"Malacca"` matched 0 rows — canonical form is `"Malakka"`; describe now says to copy exact spellings from `includeAggregations`; (2) `htrAvailable` claimed "has transcriptions" but is effectively `chamber=Zeeland` (Zeeland 70/70, Amsterdam 0/880) while many Amsterdam invs are transcribed — describe now states the real meaning. Plus two contract facts that lived only in the skill: (3) the opposite space defaults — `search_transcriptions` (Elasticsearch) space=OR vs `find_archival_documents` (FTS5) space=AND; (4) the FTS5 phrase-escape retry that sets a response `note`. `.describe()`/prose only — no schema-type, output, or behavior change; all facts verified against the DB)

## Rules

### Editorial Decisions on Content

**Flag content modifications for user review.** Any editorial decisions that modify, truncate, filter, or transform source data must be flagged before implementation and documented in CHANGELOG.md.
